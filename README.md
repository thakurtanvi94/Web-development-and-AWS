# Web-development-and-AWS


Web technology has been rapidly growing in recent years which makes it difficult to understand as to what makes each framework different from one another. This project examines 2 popular JavaScript front-end frameworks – React, Vue.js and provides a comparative analysis based on performance, core differences like data binding, state management, routing, syntax etc. and potential common vulnerabilities in each framework. The analysis is done by designing two healthcare web application – One web application uses Vue.js  and the other web application uses React.js as front end framework. Each website is hosted using AWS cloud services.  Firstly, the performance of each of this website is measured based on startup time, speed index and DOM (Document Object Model) loading time using online scanning tool Gtmetrix. Secondly, server-side and other potential vulnerabilities and exposures(CVEs) are tested using Detectify online scanner. Based on the analysis reports, counter measures are provided for low, medium, and high risks using Amazon CloudFront and serverless architecture using Lambda.
